# Skin Disease Detection
A Skin Disease Detection System (Model) using machine learning and computer vision to analyze various skin images, aiding in early diagnosis

Problem Statement:
- Skin diseases require early detection for effective treatment.-
- Existing diagnostic methods are subjective and inaccessible.
- Automated solutions face challenges with data quality and interpretability.

Tech Stack:
- Programming: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, PIL
- Model Architecture: InceptionV3 (pre-trained CNN)
- Data Augmentation: ImageDataGenerator
- Optimization: Adagrad (replaced Adam optimizer)
- Framework: Google Colab

Positive Effects of the Model:
- Improved accuracy in skin disease detection from 32% to 89.6%.
- Empowerment of individuals through proactive skin health management.
- Enhancement of dermatological care accessibility and reliability.
- Potential reduction in healthcare costs through early diagnosis.

Conclusion:
- Our Skin Disease Detection System addresses the critical need for early and accessible detection of skin diseases.
- Leveraging transfer learning (InceptionV3) and data augmentation techniques, our solution achieved a significant improvement in accuracy from 32% to 89.6%.
- With continuous refinement and innovation, our project aims to make a positive impact on dermatological care worldwide, improving health outcomes and quality of life forÂ individuals.
